still can not run yet,,but the connection to the mysql via ssh is fine.

However,you need to delete the com.example.Ebook files

* need to change your own password in the 'sshPassword' of EbookApplication.java
* maybe need to recreate database,which sql code had been add into the to files ended up with .sql
* 'Wishlists' table may not be used.
